    <p><strong>backwards</strong></p>

    <p>Recently, I read a post that talked about the benefits of approaching things backwards and I thought I would try it out. The results of the exercise are below.</p>

    <p>
      <strong>Overarching goal: to create the next trillion dollar company</strong><br>
      Well how do I do this? I make something that many people want, something that is so valuable that it changes lives<br>
      How do I do this? I find out what people want<br>
      How do I do this? I talk to as many people as possible and consume as much as possible<br>
      How do I do this? I go out there and just do it and surround myself with the smartest people in the world
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Overarching goal: find and gain the company of the smartest people in the world</strong><br>
      How do I do this? Use X, other social media, go to where they all are: San&nbsp;Francisco, currently<br>
      How do I do that? Already using X, for SF get funding to get there in some way, to live there<br>
      How do I do that? Cold email founders, provide a value proposition that they cannot miss<br>
      How do I do that? Find places where these people are concentrated (the most ambitious startups) and reach out to them, showing them why I can aid in the mission to make a trillion dollar company
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Overarching goal: to talk to as many people as possible</strong><br>
      Well how? Go and talk to people, in the library, at the gym, etc.<br>
      How? I am surrounded by people everywhere, may as well speak to them
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Overarching goal: to get a gf</strong><br>
      How do I do that? Go and talk to as many girls as possible<br>
      How do I do that? Be around as many women as possible to make it as easy as it can be<br>
      How do I do that? Go to where women go, think like a woman<br>
      How do I do that? Go to coffee shops, go to other places besides the library<br>
      How else do I do it? Go and just talk to them
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Overarching goal: to be the most knowledgeable person on all topics</strong><br>
      How do I do that? Read as much as possible and talk to ChatGPT for 15&nbsp;minutes a day about something random, non‑negotiable<br>
      How do I do that? Find the best books to read and read them, look for things recommended by intelligent people – this will create a nice network<br>
      How do I do the other? Make 15&nbsp;minutes, whenever I am doing something and just talk to chat about it
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Overarching goal: make a million dollars ARR by the end of the year</strong><br>
      How do I do that? Create something people want, something that I want and I would use<br>
      How do I get it out there? Use viral marketing, put fliers up, try various marketing strategies that could possibly work
      How do I do that? Consume content, produce content, learn my way around the algo and how things work<br>
      How do I also do that? Create as many things as possible, something is bound to work and my opportunity cost for anything is 0
