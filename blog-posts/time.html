                    Time is a mystery wrapped in inevitability. It's always there—ticking, slipping, nudging us forward whether we like it or not. Marcus Aurelius, the Stoic sage, compared it to a river: "No sooner is a thing brought to sight than it is swept by and another takes its place." That's the thing about time—it doesn't wait, doesn't ask, doesn't care. And yet, we can't stop thinking about it.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Here's the thing: time matters because it's finite. Each moment comes with a "use it or lose it" clause, and there are no refunds.
                </p>

                <blockquote>
                    "Lost time is never found again." - Benjamin Franklin
                </blockquote>

                <p>
                    Harsh, but true. We spend time like we'll get more of it tomorrow, forgetting it's a one-way street.
                </p>

                <p>
                    So why do we spend so much of that time fretting about it? Maybe it's because time calls out our limits. No matter how much we try to "save" it or "make" more of it, time marches on, indifferent to our ambitions and excuses. We set timers, make schedules, and chase it like a dog after its tail—always just out of reach.
                </p>

                <p>
                    But maybe that's okay. Maybe the trick isn't to win against time but to make peace with it. Spend it generously—on people you love, things that matter, and experiences that make you feel alive. After all, time flies, but if you're lucky, it's first class.
